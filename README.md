# flask-docker
Testing flask with Docker Dev env

It was copied from https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose, flask folder.

(I am not very familiar with Git. I tried to copy just that folder and i think i just forked the whole awesome-compose repor). Anyways, in this repo, i just created a new repor, copied the yaml files from the awesome-compose flask folder and i will use it to create docker dev enviromnet. Lets see how it goes.
